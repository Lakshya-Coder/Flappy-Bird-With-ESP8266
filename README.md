# ESP8266 Flappy Bird: A Fun and Challenging Game on OLED Display

The Flappy Bird game is a popular game, and I have recreated it on ESP8266 and 0.96 inch OLED display. This project is an exciting and fun way to learn about programming, electronics, and game development.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Flappy Bird game, you can use the code provided in this repository. The code is well-documented, and it's easy to understand and modify. If you have any trouble understanding the code, you can also check out my [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt3ARvOiSKI) where I explain it in detail.

## Requirements
To recreate the Flappy Bird game on ESP8266 and 0.96 inch OLED display, you need the following hardware components:
- ESP8266 board
- 0.96 inch display
- Breadboard
- Push button
- 10kÎ© Resistor
- Jumper wires

## Usage
Once you have all the necessary hardware components, you can upload the code to your ESP8266 board and start playing the Flappy Bird game on your OLED display. The game is easy to control using the buttons connected to your board.
